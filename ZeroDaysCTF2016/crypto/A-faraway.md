## Write-up

We are told that 191311212 is small.
If we look at the format and patterns in the given number, we can see the it is numerical and that the pattern 12 repeats twice. 
This coresponds to the repeating ll at the end of the word small which we're told the number is equal too. A quick check and we can see that 'l' is the 12th letter in the english alphabet.

Continuing with this logic we can see that s is the 19th chatecerter in the alphabet, m = 13 and a = 1.

So each letter has been replaced with a number representing its position in the alphabet. A=1, b=2, c=3 etc.

Applying this to task, we're told the flag is faraway. f=6, a=1, r=18,a=1,w=23, a=1,y=25


> FLAG: 6118123125
